## Problem Statement

<p>Given a string <code>s</code>, sort it in <strong>decreasing order</strong> based on the <strong>frequency</strong> of the characters. The <strong>frequency</strong> of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.</p>

<p>Return <em>the sorted string</em>. If there are multiple answers, return <em>any of them</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;tree&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;eert&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> &#39;e&#39; appears twice while &#39;r&#39; and &#39;t&#39; both appear once.
So &#39;e&#39; must appear before both &#39;r&#39; and &#39;t&#39;. Therefore &quot;eetr&quot; is also a valid answer.
</pre>

<p>
```

**Example 2:**

```
</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;cccaaa&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;aaaccc&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Both &#39;c&#39; and &#39;a&#39; appear three times, so both &quot;cccaaa&quot; and &quot;aaaccc&quot; are valid answers.
Note that &quot;cacaca&quot; is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
</pre>

<p>
```

**Example 3:**

```
</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;Aabb&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;bbAa&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> &quot;bbaA&quot; is also a valid answer, but &quot;Aabb&quot; is incorrect.
Note that &#39;A&#39; and &#39;a&#39; are treated as two different characters.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
```

## Constraints

- <code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>s</code> consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        dic = {}
        for i in s:
            if i in dic:
                dic[i]+=1
            else:
                dic[i]=1
        arr=[[dic[x],x] for x in dic]
        heapq.heapify(arr)
        res = []
        while len(arr):
            temp = heapq.heappop(arr)
            res.append(temp[1]*temp[0])
        return ("".join(res[::-1]))
        
```
